# Event Management System

## Overview
The Event Management System (EMS) is a web-based application designed to manage events efficiently. It allows users to create, manage, and view events. The system also supports guest login with limited access.

## Features
- **User Authentication:**
  - Users can register and log in to access full features of the system.
  - **Guest Login:** Guests can view events but cannot create, modify, or delete events.
- **Event Creation:** Users can create new events with details such as date, image, and event description.
- **Event Management:** Users can manage events they have created (edit, update, or delete).
- **Limited Guest Access:** Guests can only view event details but cannot interact with or manage events.
- **Real-time Attendee Count:** The attendee count for each event is updated in real-time. When a new user opens an event, the number of attendees is automatically updated across all connected users.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
